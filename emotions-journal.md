## 📅 How to Use This Tracker

1. **Time to Use**:  
   Every evening (before bed), take 5 minutes to think about your day.

2. **What to Do**:
   - Circle or color the face that matches your biggest feeling today.
   - Write or draw what happened.
   - If you want, write something that helped or could help next time.

3. **Be Honest & Kind**:  
   All feelings are okay. It’s okay to feel more than one thing. This is your private space to understand yourself.

4. **Ask for Help**:  
   If you want to talk about something, ask a parent, teacher, or trusted grown-up.
