# 🌄 From CBIR to Agents: A Journey Reignited

_In 2005, I worked on content-based image retrieval (CBIR) in Nepal.  
Today, I’m relearning machine learning and building agents—reconnecting with a path I left behind years ago._

## 📸 2005 — The First Spark

Back then, we believed machines could understand images.

We were working with:
- **SIFT** descriptors to detect keypoints,
- **Bag-of-Visual-Words** to represent images,
- **Inverted indexes** to retrieve similar visuals.

It was clever, but limited. No semantic understanding. No generalization.

At the time, **neural networks** were used for niche tasks—digit recognition, check processing, facial detection—but **not** for open-world problems like CBIR.

The tools were too constrained. So eventually, I moved on.

## 🔥 2012 — The World Changed with AlexNet

Then came **AlexNet**, trained on the **ImageNet** dataset:
- It used deep CNNs to extract **general-purpose visual features**,
- Outperformed everything we knew,
- And proved that neural networks could **learn from complex, real-world data**.

This wasn’t just about classification.
It was about **unlocking transferable, scalable learning**—something we had always hoped for.

## 🧠 Vision Inspired Language

What worked in vision soon crossed into NLP:
- **word2vec**, **GloVe** brought embedding-based representations,
- **Transformers** replaced RNNs with scalable attention,
- **BERT** and **GPT** showed that language could be learned end-to-end.

Just like ImageNet enabled CNNs, these models trained on massive corpora and became **general-purpose semantic engines**.

The same core idea:
> Learn to represent the world through data—not rules.

## 🎯 2021 — Multimodal Models Bridge the Gap

Then came **CLIP** (Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining):
- Trained on 400M image–text pairs,
- Aligned visual and language representations in a shared space,
- Enabled zero-shot retrieval and semantic understanding across modalities.

This was CBIR—but reimagined with meaning, not just pixels.

## 🤖 Now — Agents Don’t Just Retrieve, They Act

Today, we’re entering the era of **autonomous agents**.

These systems:
- Perceive (images, text, voice),
- Plan (multi-step reasoning),
- Use tools (APIs, code, memory),
- Adapt (based on feedback),
- And execute goals across tasks.

### 🏞️ Example: A Tourism Agent

> “Promote trekking in Annapurna this fall.”

An AI agent today can:
1. **Retrieve and generate mountain visuals** (via CBIR or DALL·E),
2. **Write captions and translations**,
3. **Generate a promo video** with voiceover,
4. **Post across platforms** using APIs,
5. **Monitor engagement**, analyze what works,
6. **Refine strategy** and adapt automatically.

This is no longer about retrieval—it’s **decision-making, creation, and autonomous improvement**.

## 🌄 My Story: Relearning, Rebuilding, Reconnecting

I didn’t continue after 2005.  
I watched the field evolve—from SIFT to CNNs, from BoW to GPT, from vision to agents.

Now, I’m relearning what I left behind:
- Rebuilding my knowledge in ML and DL,
- Understanding how large language models and multimodal systems work,
- Experimenting with tools to build autonomous agents.

I’m not here to catch up.  
I’m here because I still believe in the **original dream**—and I want to be part of where it's going next.

## 🙏 If You’re Reading This

Whether you're just starting out or returning like me:

- It's never too late to learn.
- What you build today—however small—might become the foundation for something huge.
- You don't need to be first. You just need to care enough to continue.

Thanks for reading.
