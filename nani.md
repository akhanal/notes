## Step-by-step (digit by digit)

```
     10
   _______
16 | 170
    -160
   -------
      10
```

### Step 1: How many times does 16 fit into 170?

- 16 × 10 = 160  
- 170 − 160 = **10** (remainder)

So the quotient is **10**, with a **remainder of 10**.

## Step 2: Express the Remainder

- **Quotient** = 10  
- **Remainder** = 10

So:  
**170 ÷ 16 = 10 remainder 10**

## ✍️ As a Mixed Number

170 ÷ 16 = 10 + 10/16  
= 10 + 5/8  
= **10 5⁄8**

## 💯 Final Answer

- **Quotient with remainder**: `10 R 10`  
- **Mixed number**: `10 5/8`  
- **Decimal**: `10.625`
